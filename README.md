# Go Go Protocol

A simple prototypal adventure game inspired by the 1987 classic Bureaucracy, that describes the misadventures of a person who has recently moved to a new city and begins to fall victim to various bureaucratic procedures that always go wrong.

All administrative activities are impeded by needless and confusing hurdles. In order to retrieve the lost mail and put their life back on track, the protagonist will have to meet exotic characters and perform various tasks while being constantly threatened by various bureaucratic occurrences.

The gameplay is a simulation of a computer desktop, and involves typing emails, using accounting software, writing prompts to AI agents, printing notes to affect the game world, and solving puzzles.

A special "blood pressure" meter will gradually fill itself the more the protagonist is bothered by bureaucratic annoyances. Once this meter is completely full, the player character suffers an aneurysm, and the game ends.

Initial version vibe-coded using OpenRouter and KAT-Coder-Pro V1.
